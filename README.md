<H2>Olist eCommerce Company performance</H2>

<H3> Brief </H3>

- This real dataset is provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses to channels.
Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.
- This dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and it has been anonymized and sampled from the original dataset.
- This dataset provides information of 100k orders from 2017-2018 including price, payment, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and vendors.

<H4> Brief </H4>

- I will act as a data analyst that seeks to assit the Olist Company to derive useful insights from their data and to provide recommendations.

I will split up the analyses into four sections and analyses:

1)  Sales Analyses
    - Quarterly product sales
    - Monthly product sales
    - Shipping time
    - Product order details
2)  Customer Analyses
    - Sales by geography
    - Comparative revenues of states and cities
3)  Product Analyses
     - Top selling product categories
     - Product categories by state
     - Seasonality of product categories
4)  Marketing Funnel Analyses
     - Top lead sources
     - Volume of closed deals
     - Conversion rates of lead sources
